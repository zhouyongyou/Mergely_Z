## Mergely_Z Diff Viewer

This project demonstrates a simple in-browser diff tool using
[Mergely](https://www.mergely.com/) and [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/).
It supports syntax highlighting for multiple languages and live comparison of
two text inputs.

### Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. Select the language you want from
the dropdown menu and start editing the text areas. The comparison result will
update automatically below the editors. Dark mode can be toggled with the
button on the page.

### Supported Languages

- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML
- Python
- Solidity

Additional CodeMirror modes can be added by including their corresponding
scripts and options.
